# PHPUnitBehat

> This is a fork of the original version

PHPUnitBehat provides traits that allow developers to create tests that combine 
the power & flexibility of  PHPUnit with the readability of Behat.

By including these traits in your PHPUnit test classes you can:
- use PHPUnit as your test runner as usual
- parse (Behat) Gherkin features in your PHPUnit tests
- write features as text in your PHPUnit test classes
- execute features in your PHPUnit tests
- declare methods in your PHPUnit test that are automatically matched to feature steps
- have the scenario results output as PHPUnit test results


## Requirements

* Behat 3
* PHPUnit 6+

This project currently pins symfony/dependency-injection at ^3.0 because the way we are 
accessing the Behat container is not currently compatible with Symfony 4. 
PRs to fix this are very welcome ...

## Installation

`composer require jonathanjfshaw/phpunitbehat`

## Usage

A selection of test traits are provided that help you to make use of Behat
within PHPUnit with varying degress of control.

The simplest way is to use `PHPUnitBehat\TestTraits\BehatTestTrait` 
in your test's base class.

```PHP
namespace MyProject\Tests;

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use PHPUnitBehat\TestTraits\BehatTestTrait;

class MyTestBase extends TestCase {
  use BehatTestTrait;
}
```
Create a test that extends the base class, and define a 
$feature property with corresponding step methods.

```PHP
namespace MyProject\Tests;

class MyTest extends MyTestBase {

  protected $feature = <<<'FEATURE'
Feature: Demo feature
  In order to demonstrate testing a feature in phpUnit
  We define a simple feature in the class

  Scenario: Success
    Given a step that succeeds    

  Scenario: Failure
    When a step fails
    
  Scenario: Undefined
    Then there is a step that is undefined
FEATURE;

  /**
   * @Given a step that succeeds
   */
  public function aStepThatSucceeds() {
    $this->assertTrue(true);
  }

  /**
   * @When a step fails
   */
  public function aStepFails() {
    $this->assertTrue(false);
  }

}
```

Execute your test as usual with phpunit. You should see test output like this:

```
Testing
Test 'MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #0 ('Success', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))' started
Test 'MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #0 ('Success', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))' ended
Test 'MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #1 ('Failure', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))' started
Test 'MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #1 ('Failure', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))' ended
Test 'MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #2 ('Undefined', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))' started
Test 'MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #2 ('Undefined', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))' ended


Time: 26.6 seconds, Memory: 54.25MB

There were 2 failures:

1) MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #1 ('Failure', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))
Scenario 'Failure' had steps:
Failed: When a step fails

Failed asserting that false is true.

/tests/myTest.php:35

2) MyProject\Tests\myTest::testBehatScenario with data set #2 ('Undefined', Behat\Gherkin\Node\ScenarioNode Object (...), Behat\Gherkin\Node\FeatureNode Object (...))
Failed asserting that  scenario passed.
Scenario 'Undefined' had steps:
Undefined: Then there is a step that is undefined


You can define these undefined steps in your PHPUnit test class like this:

  /**
   * @Then there is a step that is undefined
   */
  public function thereIsAStepThatIsUndefined() {

  }

```

You can specify individual scenarios to run because the scenario title is given as the data provider name. For example to test a scenario with title `Undefined`:
```
phpunit --filter '@Undefined'
```
More complex possibilities exist; see https://phpunit.de/manual/6.5/en/textui.html#textui.examples.filter-patterns.

## Notes
The code has not been tested with Behat's 'Outline' scenarios, but it should work.
